A Valentine's gift to my Wife
=============================

I've been spending a lot of time (perhaps a bit too much) on hacking keyboard firmware, so my wife gave me a request for this Valentine's day: she wants to see a heart on the Model01 prototype, and her initials.

Her wish is my command, and so this Sketch was born. It does a little more than what she asked for.
